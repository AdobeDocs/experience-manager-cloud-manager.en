>[!NOTE]

## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] 2021.10.0 is October 14, 2021.

## What's new {#whats-new}

* Production pipelines can now be executed in an "emergency" mode, bypassing security and performance testing steps for emergency deployments.

* For consistency with Cloud Service, existing deployment pipelines are now referenced and labeled in the UI as 'Full Stack' pipelines.

* The Pipeline card is now refreshed to display a single, integrated face that shows both production and non-production pipelines. A user can select Run/Pause/Resume directly from the action menu associated with each pipeline.

* A user with the **Deployment Manager** role can now delete the Production pipeline in a self-service manner by way of the UI.

* Add and edit pipeline experiences are now refreshed to use familiar, modern modals.

* Users of Cloud Manager can now submit feedback directly from the UI by way of the **Feedback** button on top right of the landing page.

* Yearly SLA Graphs can now be downloaded from the Cloud Manager user interface.

* Code quality and non-production pipeline executions now use a more efficient shallow cloning process during the build step, leading to a faster build time for customers with especially large Git repositories.

* The Cloud Manager API documentation now includes an interactive playground that allows logged-in users to experiment with the API from their browser. See [Cloud Manager API Playground](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-cloud/cloud-manager/reference/playground/) for more details.

* The tool tip on the Program card is now more descriptive if a selection option under 'Navigate To' is disabled. It now says, "A production environment does not exist."


## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* When data read from internal systems is input correctly, it could cause unrelated data provided by Adobe CSEs (Customer Success Engineer) not to be reflected properly in Cloud Manager. 

* In specific customer situations, invalid artifacts downloaded during the build step, which should have caused a build failure, were being ignored.
