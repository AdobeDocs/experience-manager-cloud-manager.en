# Release notes for Cloud Manager 2021.2.0 {#release-notes-for}

The following section outlines the general release notes for [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] 2021.2.0.

## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] 2021.2.0 is February 11, 2021.

## What's new {#whats-new}

* The AEM Project Archetype used in project creation has been updated to version 25. 

* The list of deprecated APIs identified during code scanning has been refined to include additional classes and methods deprecated in the latest Cloud Service SDK releases.

* Production deployments now deploy to the paired publish and dispatcher instances in parallel. 

* SonarQube profile for Cloud Manager updated to remove Sonar rule `squid:S2142`. This will no longer conflict with thread interruption checks.

* Properties set in customer `pom.xml` files prefixed with sonar will now be dynamically removed in order to avoid build and quality scanning failures.

* Additional Code Quality Rules have been added to cover Cloud Service Compatibility issues.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* On occasion, the CI/CD (deployment) pipeline failed during a performance test step due to a container running the load test which encountered an error.

* On occasion, load test container may report the run as failed even if only one exception happens. The failure will be reported only if the testing process cannot be restored.

* Certain casing mismatches between the way environment names were stored would lead to performance testing failures.

* Some pipeline failures were incorrectly reported as pipeline errors.
