## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] 2021.6.0 is June 10, 2021.
The next release is planned for July 15, 2021.

## What's new {#whats-new}

* Assets and Sites tests now run in parallel (when applicable). This workflow reduces the total pipeline execution time. This feature is being enabled over the next several weeks.

* Maven Dependencies downloaded during the build step are now cached between pipeline executions. This feature is being enabled over the next several weeks. 

* The default branch name used during both project creation and in the default push command via manage Git workflows has been changed to `main`. 

* Edit program experience in the UI has been refreshed. See [Edit a program](/help/getting-started/program-setup.md#editing-program) to learn more.

* The quality rule `ImmutableMutableMixCheck` has been updated to classify `/oak:index` nodes as being immutable.

* The quality rules `CQBP-84` and `CQBP-84--dependencies` have been consolidated into a single rule. As part of this consolidation, the scanning of dependencies more accurately identifies issues in third party dependencies that are deployed to the AEM runtime.

* In some situations, a failure to calculate the Skipped Tests metric would cause pipeline executions to fail.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* JCR node definitions containing a newline after the root element name were not correctly parsed.

* List repositories API would not filter deleted repositories.

* An incorrect error message was displayed when an invalid value was provided for the schedule step. 

* In certain cases, when the pipeline execution reached the production deployment step and the user stopped it, the user interface's deploy status message did not accurately show the current status. The message failed to reflect the actual process.
