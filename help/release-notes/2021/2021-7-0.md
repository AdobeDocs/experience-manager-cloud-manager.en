* The **Manage Git** buttons is now retitled to **Access Git Info** and the dialog box is now visually refreshed. 

* The version of the AEM Project Archetype used by Cloud Manager has been updated to version 28.

* Some unexpected topology reconfigurations could result in detailed testing reports no longer being available from the pipeline execution details page.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* Manually navigating to the execution details page for a non-existing execution did not show an error, just an endless loading screen. 

* In some cases, the automatic retry for failed containers used in Sites performance would not take effect for 2 hours, resulting in a test failure.

## Known issues {#known-issues}

Customers switching to the Azul JDKs should be aware that some existing applications may encounter compilation errors on the Azul JDK. Adobe recommends that you test locally before switching.
