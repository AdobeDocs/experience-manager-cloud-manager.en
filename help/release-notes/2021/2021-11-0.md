* Pipeline PATCH API fails if the deploy phase does not exist.

* The `ClientlibProxyResourceCheck` quality rule was producing false positive issues when there were client libraries with common base paths.

* The error message, when the maximum number of repositories was reached, did not specify the reason for the error.

* In rare cases, pipelines were failing due to inappropriate retry handling of certain response codes.
