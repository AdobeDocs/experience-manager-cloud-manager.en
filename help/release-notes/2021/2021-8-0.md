## What's new {#whats-new}

* There is now an API available to invalidate the Maven dependency cache per pipeline.

* The version of the AEM Project Archetype used by Cloud Manager has been updated to version 29. 

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* Occasionally, when a pipeline is triggered twice for some reason, it results in one of the executions failing with *cannot update pipeline execution status* error.
