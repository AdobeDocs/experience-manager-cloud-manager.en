## Early adoption program {#early-adoption}

Be a part of Cloud Manager's early adoption program and have a chance to test upcoming features.

### Bring Your Own Git - now with extensions for Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub Enterprise Server

After enabling you to directly use your GitHub-hosted repositories in Cloud Manager, you can now also onboard your Bitbucket, GitLab, or self-hosted GitHub repositories and [link them to your pipelines](/help/managing-code/private-repositories.md#pipelines). This integration eliminates the need to sync code consistently with the Adobe repository. For now, the pull requests code quality checks that come out-of-the box for GitHub-hosted repositories are not yet available for other Git vendors, but an update to cover that functionality is planned.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to [Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-CloudManager_BYOG.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.

### Staging-only and production-only pipelines {#staging-production-only-pipelines}

Adobe announces the introduction of support for [staging-only and production-only pipelines](/help/using/stage-prod-only.md). This new feature lets you divide full-stack production deployment pipelines into smaller, more specialized deployments.

If you would like to test this feature and provide feedback, email [Grp-cloudmanager_splitpipelines@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-cloudmanager_splitpipelines@adobe.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.
