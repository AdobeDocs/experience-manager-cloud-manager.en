## Early adoption program {#early-adoption}

Be a part of Cloud Manager's early adoption program and have a chance to test upcoming features.

### Bring Your Own Git - now with extensions for Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub Enterprise Server

Following the introduction of direct support for GitHub-hosted repositories in Cloud Manager, you can now also onboard repositories from Bitbucket, GitLab, or self-hosted GitHub and [link them to your pipelines](/help/managing-code/private-repositories.md#pipelines). This integration removes the need for constant code synchronization with the Adobe repository. Currently, the out-of-the-box pull request code quality checks are exclusive to GitHub-hosted repositories, but an update to extend this functionality to other Git vendors is in the works.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to [Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.

### Staging-only and production-only pipelines {#staging-production-only-pipelines}

Adobe announces the introduction of support for [staging-only and production-only pipelines](/help/using/stage-prod-only.md). This new feature lets you divide full-stack production deployment pipelines into smaller, more specialized deployments.

If you would like to test this feature and provide feedback, email [Grp-cloudmanager_splitpipelines@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-cloudmanager_splitpipelines@adobe.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.
