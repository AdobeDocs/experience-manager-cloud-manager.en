### Self-service Service Pack updates for AMS Cloud Manager customers 

As part of the early adopters program, Adobe Managed Services Cloud Manager customers can now perform self-service service pack updates through the **Cloud Manager** user interface.

Customers can check for service pack updates on the **Program Overview** page under the **Environments** section (**three-dot menu**).
