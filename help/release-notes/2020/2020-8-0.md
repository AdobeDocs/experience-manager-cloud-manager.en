* When deploying to topologies with a single publish, a single dispatcher and a cold standby author, the dispatcher was erroneously removed from the load balancer. 

* In some cases, completed pipeline executions were not successfully recorded as having been completed thereby preventing new executions of the pipeline.

* Pipeline executions would occasionally get *stuck* due to internal communication issues.

* The tooltip on the program cards were not consistently correct.

* There was a color mismatch on the **Overview** page.

* Sites Performance Testing now supports the optional use of authentication.
