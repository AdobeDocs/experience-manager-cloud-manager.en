## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] 2020.3.0 is March 5, 2020.

## What's new {#whats-new}

* The log for the build step is now available while the build step is running.
* Some of the messages on the pipeline execution details page have been edited for clarity.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* Certain deployment configurations could cause logs for the deploy steps to be unavailable if the deployment failed.
* Specific failures inside the deployment steps for Managed Services programs could cause subsequent executions to fail to start.
* The ephemeral SonarQube instance used in the build step was occasionally failing to start within the configured timeout.
* In specific projects, the *ResourceResolver objects should always be closed* would produce a Null Pointer Exception; this, however, did not impact pipeline execution.
