## What's new {#what-is-new}

* **Staging-only and production-only pipelines**

    Cloud Manager now supports staging-only and production-only pipelines. This feature lets you split full-stack production deployments into smaller, purpose-specific pipelines. <!-- This feature went into GA from Private beta in the June 5, 2025 CM release -->

    See [Stage-Only and Prod-Only Pipelines](/help/using/stage-prod-only.md).

* **Pipeline favorites**

    In this release, Cloud Manager introduces the ability to pin favorite pipelines, letting you mark specific pipelines as favorites so they appear at the top of the list on the **Pipelines** page. This enhancement makes frequently accessed pipelines easier to find and run. <!-- CMGR-68293 -->

    See [Mark pipeline favorites](/help/using/managing-pipelines.md#pipeline-favorites).


## Alpha/Beta programs {#beta-program}

Participate in Cloud Manager's alpha and beta programs to get exclusive access to upcoming features before their general release.

The following opportunities are currently available:


### Bring Your Own Git - now with support for GitLab and Bitbucket {#gitlab-bitbucket}

The **Bring Your Own Git** (BYOG) feature has been expanded to include support for external repositories, such as GitLab and Bitbucket. This new support is in addition to the already existing support for private and enterprise GitHub repositories. When you add these new repos, you can also link them directly to your pipelines. You can host these repositories on public cloud platforms or within your private cloud or infrastructure. This integration also removes the need for constant code synchronization with the Adobe repository and provides the ability to validate pull requests before merging them into a main branch.

Pipelines using external repositories (excluding GitHub-hosted ones) and the **Deployment Trigger** set to **On Git Changes** now start automatically.

See [Add external repositories in Cloud Manager](/help/managing-code/external-repositories.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, the out-of-the-box pull request code quality checks are exclusive to GitHub-hosted repositories, but an update to extend this functionality to other Git vendors is in the works.

#### Manage Access Tokens{#access-tokens}
