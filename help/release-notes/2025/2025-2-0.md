## What's new {#what-is-new}

<!-- * The AEM Code Quality step now uses SonarQube 9.9 Server, replacing the older 7.4 version. This upgrade brings additional security, performance, and code quality checks, offering more comprehensive analysis and coverage for your projects. --> <!-- CMGR-45683 -->

* **Upgraded SonarQube**

    Starting Thursday, February 13, 2025, the Cloud Manager code quality step now uses SonarQube 9.9.5.90363.

    The updated rules, available for AMS at [this link](/help/using/code-quality-testing.md#code-quality-testing-step), determine security scores and code quality for Cloud Manager pipelines.

* SonarQube 9.9 is now the default code quality scanning engine for all customers.

* **Java 17 and Java 21 build environment support**

    Customers can now optionally build with Java 17 or Java 21, benefiting from performance improvements and new language features. See [Build environment](/help/getting-started/build-environment.md) for configuration steps, including updating your Maven project description, and certain library versions.

    >[!NOTE]
    >For Cloud Service environments, when the build version is set to Java 17 or Java 21, the runtime defaults to Java 21.

* **Content Copy validations extended**

    Content copy validation rules have been updated. With this release, users can no longer trigger a content copy if there are active pipeline executions in either the source or destination environment. Users must wait until all ongoing pipeline executions are complete before initiating a content copy.

## Early adoption program {#early-adoption}

Be a part of Cloud Manager's early adoption program and have a chance to test upcoming features.

### Bring Your Own Git - now with support for GitLab and Bitbucket {#gitlab-bitbucket}

The **Bring Your Own Git** feature has been expanded to include support for external repositories, such as GitLab and Bitbucket. This new support is in addition to the already existing support for private and enterprise GitHub repositories. When you add these new repos, you can also link them directly to your pipelines. You can host these repositories on public cloud platforms or within your private cloud or infrastructure. This integration also removes the need for constant code synchronization with the Adobe repository and provides the ability to validate pull requests before merging them into a main branch.

Pipelines using external repositories (excluding GitHub-hosted ones) and the **Deployment Trigger** set to **On Git Changes** now start automatically.

See [Add external repositories in Cloud Manager](/help/managing-code/external-repositories.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, the out-of-the-box pull request code quality checks are exclusive to GitHub-hosted repositories, but an update to extend this functionality to other Git vendors is in the works.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to [Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID. Be sure to include which Git platform you want to use and whether you are on a private/public or enterprise repository structure. -->
