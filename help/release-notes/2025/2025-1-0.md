## What's new {#what-is-new}

**Code Quality Rules - Sonar Cube Upgrade:** Cloud Manager Code Quality step will start using SonarQube Server 9.9 with Cloud Manager 2025.2.0 release, scheduled for Thursday, February 13, 2025. 

To prepare, updated SonarQube rules are now available at [Code Quality Rules](/help/using/code-quality-testing.md#code-quality-testing-step).

You can "early check" the new rules by setting the following pipeline text variable (see screenshot below): 

`CM_BUILD_IMAGE_OVERRIDE` = `self-service-build:sonar-99-upgrade-java17or21`

Additionally, set the following variable to ensure the code quality step runs for the same commit (normally skipped for the same `commitId`): 

`CM_DISABLE_BUILD_REUSE` = `true`

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends creating a new CI/CD Code Quality pipeline, configured to the same branch as your main production pipeline. Set the appropriate variables *before* the February 13, 2025 release to validate that the new enforced rules do not introduce blockers.
