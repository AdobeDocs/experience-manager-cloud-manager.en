## Early adoption program {#early-adoption}

Participate in Cloud Manager's Early Adoption Program to get exclusive access to upcoming features before their general release.

The following early adoption opportunities are currently available:

### Bring Your Own Git - now with support for GitLab and Bitbucket {#gitlab-bitbucket}

The **Bring Your Own Git** feature has been expanded to include support for external repositories, such as GitLab and Bitbucket. This new support is in addition to the already existing support for private and enterprise GitHub repositories. When you add these new repos, you can also link them directly to your pipelines. You can host these repositories on public cloud platforms or within your private cloud or infrastructure. This integration also removes the need for constant code synchronization with the Adobe repository and provides the ability to validate pull requests before merging them into a main branch.

Pipelines using external repositories (excluding GitHub-hosted ones) and the **Deployment Trigger** set to **On Git Changes** now start automatically.

See [Add external repositories in Cloud Manager](/help/managing-code/external-repositories.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, the out-of-the-box pull request code quality checks are exclusive to GitHub-hosted repositories, but an update to extend this functionality to other Git vendors is in the works.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to [Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID. Be sure to include which Git platform you want to use and whether you are on a private/public or enterprise repository structure.

### Staging-only and production-only pipelines {#staging-production-only-pipelines}

Adobe announces the introduction of support for [staging-only and production-only pipelines](/help/using/stage-prod-only.md). This new feature lets you divide full-stack production deployment pipelines into smaller, more specialized deployments.

If you would like to test this feature and provide feedback, email [Grp-cloudmanager_splitpipelines@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-cloudmanager_splitpipelines@adobe.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.

### Self-service Service Pack updates for AMS Cloud Manager customers 

As part of the early adopters program, Adobe Managed Services Cloud Manager customers can now perform self-service service pack updates through the **Cloud Manager** user interface. This feature is currently available *only for development environments* and includes limited error reporting for failures.  

Customers can check for service pack updates on the **Program Overview** page under the **Environments** section (**three-dot menu**).

![Check for updates menu option](/help/release-notes/assets/check-for-updates-1.png)

![Update Service Pack dialog box](/help/release-notes/assets/check-for-updates-2.png)

The installation and upgrade process can be tracked on the **Activity** page. 

Once the process is complete, customers must **approve the execution** for the service pack upgrade to finalize successfully.
