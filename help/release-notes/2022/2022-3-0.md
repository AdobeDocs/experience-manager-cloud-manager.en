* The **Skip Load Balancer changes** option was unable to be disabled.
* The **Skip Load Balancer changes** option was not displayed on the AMS Dev Deploy **Edit Pipeline Workflow**. 
* A subset of manually created Git repositories had an incorrect name value. This issue prevented the build artifact reuse feature from being effective. The names of those repositories have been changed and users can now see the corrected name in the Cloud Manager API/UI.
* Build artifacts from non-production pipelines were inappropriately reused on production full stack pipelines.
    * When adding or editing a code quality pipeline, the options to handle metric failures are no longer displayed.
