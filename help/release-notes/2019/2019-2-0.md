* When a pipeline execution was started from the Web UI, the browser back button did not function correctly.
* The Learn More links on the Overview page did not open a new tab.
* When uploading a program thumbnail, it may not have been immediately visible.
* In some cases, Code Scanning failed because of project-specific configuration.

* When a quality gate was overridden, the status was displayed inconsistently.
* Customers using cold standby topologies received incorrect results for security tests.

## Known issues {#known-issues}

* When monitoring data is refreshed, any hidden series are unhidden.
* Customers wanting to view their existing SLA reports must manually navigate until the next release. 

  To formulate this URL, follow the pattern (`https://<Experience Cloud URL>/content/mac/<Experience Cloud Tenant>/managedservices/sla.html`), for example, if URL for your Experience Cloud is (`https://weretailprod.experiencecloud.adobe.com`), then your SLA reports URL is (`https://weretailprod.experiencecloud.adobe.com/content/mac/weretailprod/managedservices/sla/html`).

  Resolution of this issue is expected in the next release with the availability of SLA reports inside [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager].
