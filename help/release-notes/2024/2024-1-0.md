### Bring your own GitHub {#byo-github}

If you use GitHub to manage your repositories, [you can now validate code directly within your GitHub repositories through Cloud Manager.](/help/managing-code/byo-github.md) This integration eliminates the need to consistently sync code with the Adobe repository and allows you to verify pull requests before merging them into the main branches. This feature is exclusive to public GitHub. Support for self-hosted GitHub is not available.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, please send an email to `Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com` from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.

## Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes}

* An error was corrected for some corner cases where downloads failed due to how the test application interprets data, causing the total error percentage to fail the test.
* When a build step finishes with status `FAILED` due to a `BUILD_MAVEN_TRANSFER_ARTIFACT_ERROR`, it is now properly described as an error due to merge conflicts with the destination branch.
