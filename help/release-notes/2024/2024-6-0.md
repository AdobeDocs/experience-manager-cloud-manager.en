## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] 2024.6.0 is June 6, 2024. The next release is planned for July 11, 2024.

## What's new {#what-is-new}

* You can now [use your own GitHub repositories](/help/managing-code/private-repositories.md) as sources for full-stack pipelines.

  * You can also use GitHub repositories with [Git submodules](/help/managing-code/git-submodules.md) to gain better control over auto-generated pipelines for pull request validation. This setup lets you define specific behaviors for crucial metrics during the code scanning phase.
  * [You also have the choice](/help/managing-code/github-check-config.md) to preserve the report history on GitHub, name the pipeline, and set pipeline variables to suit your needs.
* New OakPal rules were added to the [Cloud Manager Code Quality scan](/help/using/custom-code-quality-rules.md#oakpal-ui-content-package).
  * Every new rule added as of June 2024 is a non-breaking change.
  * You are urged to address these changes as soon as possible because these new rules can cause pipelines to fail starting with the Cloud Manager August 2024 release.
