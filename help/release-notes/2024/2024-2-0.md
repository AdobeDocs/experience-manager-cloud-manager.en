## What's new {#what-is-new}

* As part of [deployment](/help/using/code-deployment.md), the Dispatcher cache was flushed at the **Attach Dispatcher** step. To test changes on each node before attaching it to the application load balancer, after deploying code to a particular publisher, you can now test changes directly from the associated Dispatcher before attaching that Dispatcher to the load balancer.
* [The build environment](/help/getting-started/build-environment.md) has been updated to Maven version 3.9.4 and JDK versions jdk-11.0.22 and jdk1.8.0_401.

### Bring your own GitHub {#byo-github}

If you use GitHub to manage your repositories, [you can now validate code directly within your GitHub repositories through Cloud Manager](/help/managing-code/private-repositories.md). This integration eliminates the need to sync code consistently with the Adobe repository and lets you verify pull requests before merging them into the main branches. This feature is exclusive to public GitHub. Support for self-hosted GitHub is not available.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to `Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com` from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* The JDK of the build containers has been updated to a version that solves [JDK-8313765](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8313765).
