# Notifications{#notifications}

Cloud Manager allows the users to receive notifications when a Pipeline starts and completes (successfully or unsuccessfully) as well as when the** Go-Live Approval **and** Scheduled **steps are reached. These notifications are sent through the Adobe Experience Cloud Notification system.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The approval and scheduled notifications are only sent to users in the Business Owner, Program Manager, and Deployment Manager roles.

The notifications appear in a sidebar in Cloud Manager UI (User Interface) and throughout the Adobe Experience Cloud.

Click on the bell icon from the header to open the sidebar and view the notifications, as shown in the figure below:

Click on the gear icon at the bottom of the notifications sidebar, as shown in the figure below:
