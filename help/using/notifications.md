# Notifications {#notifications}

[!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] allows the users to receive notifications at the start of a production deployment as well as when the **Go-Live Approval** and **Scheduled** steps are reached. These notifications are sent through the Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] Notification system.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The approval and scheduled notifications are only sent to users in the Business Owner, Program Manager, and Deployment Manager roles.

The notifications appear in a sidebar in [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] UI (User Interface) and throughout the Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud].

Click on the bell icon from the header to open the sidebar and view the notifications, as shown in the figure below:
