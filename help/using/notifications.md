Learn how Cloud Manager notifies you of important events.

## Notifications in Cloud Manager {#cloud-manager-notifications}

[!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] sends you notifications when a production pipeline starts and completes (successfully or unsuccessfully), at the start of a production deployment, as well as when the **Go-Live Approval** and **Scheduled** steps are reached. These notifications are sent through the [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] notification system.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The approval and scheduled notifications are only sent to users in the **Business Owner**, **Program Manager**, and **Deployment Manager** roles.

The notifications appear in a sidebar within [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] and throughout the Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud].

The bell icon in the header is badged when you have new notifications.

This will take the user to the **Notifications Preferences** screen in Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud].

The users can turn on email notifications and (optionally) select the types of notifications they want to receive over email. You can also specify to receive your notifications as a daily or weekly digest from the Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud], as shown below:
