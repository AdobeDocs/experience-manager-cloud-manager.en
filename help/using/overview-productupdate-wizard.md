# Overview {#overview-product-update-wizard}

The Product Update wizard is a guided, step-by-step experience for Cloud Manager customers who are upgrading to the latest Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.5. It streamlines the end-to-end process, ensures adherence to AEM best practices using Cloud Managerâ€™s CI/CD framework and built-in automated testing.

The wizard includes five phases that guides the user during an AEM product update:

* **Evaluation**
* **Remediation**
* **Execution**
* **Validation**
* **Completion**

1. You will receive a pulse notification via Cloud Manager informing you that AEM 6.5 is available to your program.

1. An **[!UICONTROL AEM 6.5 Update]** card displays on the overview screen of [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager]. This card will help track which phase of the update process you are currently in and will inform you as to what the next step to be taken is. Select **[!UICONTROL Start Update]** to launch the wizard.
