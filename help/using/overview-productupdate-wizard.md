# Overview to Product Update Wizard {#overview-product-update-wizard}

The Product Update wizard is a guided, step-by-step experience for Cloud Manager customers who are upgrading to the latest Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.5. It streamlines the end-to-end process, ensures adherence to AEM best practices using Cloud Managerâ€™s CI/CD framework and built-in automated testing.

The wizard includes five phases that guides the user during an AEM product update. The five phases are:

* **Evaluation**
* **Remediation**
* **Execution**
* **Validation**
* **Completion**

>[!NOTE]
   >The current release of Product Update feature in Cloud Manager supports the **Evaluation** phase only. The other four phases namely **Remediation**, **Execution**, **Validation**, and **Completion** are coming soon.
