# Introduction {#introduction}

The Product Update Wizard is a guided, step-by-step experience for Cloud Manager customers who are upgrading to the latest Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.5. It streamlines the end-to-end process, ensures adherence to AEM best practices all the while using Cloud Managerâ€™s CI/CD framework and built-in automated testing.

The wizard includes five phases that the user will be guided through during an AEM product update including Evaluation, Remediation, Execution, Validation, and Completion. 

>[!NOTE]
   >The current release of product update feature in Cloud Manager supports the **Evaluation** phase only. The other four phases namely **Remediation**, **Execution**, **Validation**, and **Completion** are coming soon.
