# Environments Provisioned{#environments-provisioned}

## Provisioning {#provisioning}

During the customer on-boarding process, all the AEM cloud environments purchased by a customer will be automatically provisioned by Adobe, and linked back to their program in [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager]. These AEM cloud **Environments** are included in every Adobe Managed Services subscription, and are usually comprised of at least one production environment, one stage environment, and optionally one or more development or test environments.

## Welcome Email {#welcome-email}

Upon completion of the environment provisioning process, the designated customer administrator receives a **welcome email** with the confirmation they have been granted access to the Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud]. The email contains detailed information on how to get started with the [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] services, the [!UICONTROL AEM Managed Services] cloud environments, as well as the [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] self-service portal. Additionally, the email contains important information such as the Customer Success Engineer contact information, where to go for Support Resources, Forums, or FAQs, and much more. In the list of resources provided in the email, you will also get details on how to access [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] or your AEM cloud environments.

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

After receiving the welcome email, you are ready to log in to [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] as an administrator, using your Adobe IMS credentials. Once logged in, you will be able to verify that your AEM cloud production and non-production environmnents are available, and running successfully.

These AEM cloud environments will be used by [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] to execute the CI/CD pipeline when deploying your code, starting from the [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager]'s Git repository, through the staging **Environment**, and up to your AEM production environment. You will also be able to access your AEM cloud environments directly from [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager], when you are ready to start creating digital experiences for your web properties.
