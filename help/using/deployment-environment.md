# Deployment Environment{#deployment-environment}

You may be new to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.4 or need an upgrade to AEM 6.4 Release.

If you are a new to AEM 6.4, then you already have access to Cloud Manager.

If you are an existing customer, then you need to upgrade to AEM 6.4 to have access to Cloud Manager. You can start using Cloud Manager, once you receive URL and credentials from Customer Success Engineers (CSE).
