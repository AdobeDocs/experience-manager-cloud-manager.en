# Environment provisioning {#environments-provisioning}

Learn how your environments are provisioned as part of the Cloud Manager onboarding process.

## Provisioning {#provisioning}

During the onboarding process, Adobe automatically provisions all the AEM cloud environments you purchased and links them to your program in [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager]. Every Adobe Managed Services subscription includes AEM cloud environments. They typically include at least one production environment and one staging environment. Optionally, they may also include one or more development or testing environments.

## Welcome email {#welcome-email}

Upon completion of the environment provisioning process, the designated customer administrator receives a welcome email with the confirmation that they have been granted access to Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud]. The welcome email contains detailed information on how to get started with [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] services, [!UICONTROL AEM Managed Services] cloud environments, and [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] self-service portal. Additionally, the email contains important information such as the Customer Success Engineer (CSE) contact information, where to go for support resources, forums, FAQs, and much more. In the list of resources provided in the email, you also get details on how to access [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] for your AEM cloud environments.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

After receiving the welcome email, you are ready to log in to [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] as a system administrator, using your Adobe IMS credentials. After logging in, you can check that your AEM cloud production and non-production environments are available and running smoothly.

[!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] uses these AEM cloud environments to run the CI/CD pipeline. It deploys code from its Git repository to the staging environment. Then it deploys the code to your AEM production environment. You can also access your AEM cloud environments directly from [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] when you are ready to start creating digital experiences for your web properties.
