When the wizard closes, your new repository is displayed in the table in the **Repositories** window. You can now associate a [CI/CD pipeline](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/introduction-ci-cd-pipelines.md) with it or manage it within the [**Repositories** window.](managing-repositories)

>[!TIP]

>You can also add GitHub repositories that you manage yourself as [private repositories.](private-repositories.md)
