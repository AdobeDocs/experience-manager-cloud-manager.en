The **Repositories** window makes it easy to add additional Adobe-managed repositories for your program.

1. Log into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization and program.

1. From the **Program Overview** page, select the **Repositories** tab to switch to the **Repositories** page.

1. Click **Add Repository** in the toolbar.

When the wizard closes, your new repository is displayed in the table in the **Repositories** window. You can now associate a [CI/CD pipeline](/help/overview/ci-cd-pipelines.md) with it or manage it within the [**Repositories** window](managing-repositories.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>You can also add GitHub repositories that you manage yourself as [private repositories](private-repositories.md).
