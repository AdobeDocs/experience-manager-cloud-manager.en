You can continue to the document [Program Setup](/help/getting-started/program-setup.md) for the next steps in setting up your program.

## Cloud Manager activity {#activity}

Cloud Manager provides a consolidated view into a program's activity. It lists all CI/CD pipeline executions, both production and non-production. Such functionality gives you visibility into past and present activity.

>[!TIP]

>For details on how to use the Cloud Manager UI, see [Navigating the Cloud Manager UI](/help/getting-started/navigation.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>By default, a user with access to an AEM environment also has the Cloud Manager User role. This role is insufficient to give the user access to program details view. Such a user with only the Cloud Manager User role is able to navigate by way of the program menu options to the AEM environment author URL (if environments exist). Such users must contact their administrator if they want to get program-level access.
