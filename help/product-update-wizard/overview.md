# Product Update Wizard {#product-update-wizard}

The Product Update wizard is a guided, step-by-step upgrade experience to the latest version of Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 using Cloud Manager. It streamlines the end-to-end process and ensures adherence to AEM best practices using Cloud Manager’s CI/CD framework and built-in automated testing.

The wizard includes five phases that guides you during an AEM product update:

* Evaluation
* Remediation
* Execution
* Validation
* Completion
